## It Begins

A long time ago, in a board room far, far away a gallant group of product designers at Samsung put together a beautiful 1080p television. A crisp 52 inch LED display, glass 2.5 inch bezel sporting an elegant burgundy to black gradient, "touch" controls, and a whopping four HDMI inputs all lived proudly on this television. The [Samsung LN52A750](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/544327-REG/Samsung_LN52A750R1FXZA_LN52A750_52_1080p.html) would be sold for more than $2,500 US--it had to be good.

Years later, the scavengers of the world would get their hands on this TV (myself included) for the low-low price of fuck-all; thank you, mindless consumerism! Fewer would deem to use this TV as their primary PC display. I was one of those lucky fools.

In 2008, you could hardly get a prettier television. In 2020, we expect a few things from our TVs that we didn't back then. Exhibit A: we want our TVs to time-out after No Signal. A primary fault of this particular display was that it did not, in fact, time-out after No Signal. It will instead stay on all night, telling you just how little signal it is receiving.

## So what?

So? We don't just settle for shit like that, come on! We make things!
