    <h2>What services does techdude provide?</h2>
    It would be easier to list services I <i>can't</i> provide. With that said, here's a (non-exhaustive) list of things I do regularly:
</header>
<style>
    ul {
        margin-top: 1em;
        margin-left: 1em;
    }
</style>
+ Level 1/2 IT Support (Read: "How do I...")
+ Audio/Video set-up/consultation (including home video surveillance)
+ Home Automation
+ Graphic Design
+ Website Design/Development
+ Specialized Electronics
+ Very basic board-level repair

Pricing is negotiable based on services rendered and time until we adopt a consistent model. If you need something done that's not on this list and it involves a computer, just [send me an e-mail](mailto:denniszarger@gmail.com) and I'll be happy to talk with you.
