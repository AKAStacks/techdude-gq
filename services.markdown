    <h2>What services does techdude provide?</h2>
    Please note: this list is non-exhaustive--that is, if it involves electronics somehow, I can probably do it. Here is a list of things I do regularly:
</header>
<style>
    ul {
        margin-top: 1em;
        margin-left: 1em;
    }
</style>
+ Tier 1-4 IT Support (I can help you with your computer/phone/server)
+ Audio/Video set-up/consultation (including home video surveillance)
+ Home Automation
+ Graphic Design
+ Website Design/Development
+ Specialized Electronics
+ Very basic board-level repair

Pricing is negotiable based on services rendered and time consumed until I adopt a consistent model. Pricing starts at $15/hr If you need something done that's not on this list and it involves a computer, just [send me an e-mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}) and I'll be happy to talk with you.
